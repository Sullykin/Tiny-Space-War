Chapter 1- Introduction
-----------------------
You: I've decided to join the Afterlife Battlefront.

Recruiter: And why is that?

You: I think I can be a val-

Recruiter: You know what, forget it. We need everyone we can get.
We have a squad going out on a scavenging mission soon to bring back some resources.
They need another person to help fend off enemy ships, though there shouldn't be too many that far out. 
This mission will also double as your exam. Depending on your performance, we may place you on one of the support squadrons.
Are you up for the task?

You: Absolutely.

Recruiter: Great. I'll send you the coordinates to meet up with your squadron. Good luck.

...
(you meet up with the scavenger squadron)

Squad Member: Of course we are left to do the grunt work. Maybe if we're lucky we'll still see some action.
Hey rookie, what did they even arm you with anyway?

You: I believe its just some basic rounds, but they also gave me an EMP in case something goes wrong.

Squad Member: An EMP, eh? I think that's a little overkill where we're going...
Don't use it unless you really have to. That stuff ain't cheap.

You: Right. So, uh, could you give me a quick refresher on how to use it?

Squad Member: Press F on your ship's console when you're ready to activate it.
That bad boy will temporarily disable all enemy ships within range for 5 seconds.

You: Roger that.

...

Squad Member: The objective is just ahead. Stay close while we extract what we need.
